--OI
write N,P,N-P

--FFT
write N? NOT DONE YET

--FFT_Rearrange
write PKTLEN (N), BINS

--Ram Multiply
write entire ram
Write PKTLEN THIS ISN'T DONE? I don't think this is necessary as the read addresses are generated from tuser in, and the output tuser and tlast are copied from the datastream through the multiplier core

--Stack Add
write N, N/D, log2(N/(N/D))

--IFFT
write N/D? NOT DONE YET

-- DS
write N/D, P/D
